# Project - Data Analysis

This project is centered around exploratory data 
analysis [(EDA)](./Terezas_EDA_Checklist.pdf) techniques and statistical analysis.

## Topic and Task

Your task will be to complete a case study to answer specific questions of our stakeholder by performing data analysis and visualisation. 
You can find the detailed task description [here](./Assignment.md).

## Getting Started

- Please create a new repository on GitHub and invite all team members to collaborate.
  - Include a .gitignore file to your repo. At the least your data folder should be listed, since you want to make sure not to push any data to GitHub.
- Start VS Code!
- Either use your nf_base environment or if you want to experiment with new packages:
  - Create a new virtual environment, eg.:  
```BASH 
# Create new environment
$ conda create --name <env_name> python=3.9
# Activate environment 
$ conda activate <env_name>
# Installing packages 
$ conda install <package_name>
```
  - Also after having created this environment, you can install additional packages within it. **Make sure you have activated your environment before installing new packages within it**!
  - Work in branches and push your changes to the repository in order to keep your notebooks synchronised.
  - Create a new .ipynb file and start with your EDA!
  - When working seperately from teammates use different files that can be combined later, or work carefully to avoid merge conflicts!


## Suggested workflow - MVP
The work is timeboxed, and with that in mind, you need to change how you approach the task. You will want to employ an iterative approach. 

* Write a plan of how you will complete the project. Refer to this regularly.
* When unsure or facing overly complex topics: make assumptions or simplifications that allow you to move on with your plan.
* Make simple plots
* Main questions should be answered first -> Think MVP (minimum viable product) and POC (proof of concept) 
* Iterate: go deeper, go prettier, go better
* Clean up .. feel free to delete things that are not useful anymore (even if you spent loads of time on it!)
 

**Have fun and do not stress yourself too much!!!**
