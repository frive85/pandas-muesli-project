# 📊 Muesli Project – Data Analysis

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **statistical analysis** to uncover insights from logistics and warehouse operations data. The goal is to support decision-making by answering key business questions, identifying performance bottlenecks, and driving improvements in delivery efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Analyze operational data to evaluate **logistics and warehouse performance**, focusing on:
- Delivery timelines
- Pickup delays
- Overall efficiency
- Customer satisfaction

The insights aim to **optimize operations**, **improve customer experience**, and **support strategic improvements**.

> *“Faster deliveries = happier customers”*  
> — Key takeaway from the analysis

## 📈 Key Results & Insights

### 📊 Performance Metrics (Total Time)

| KPI | Total Time | Workdays |
|-----|------------|----------|
| **Logistics Performance** | ~4 days 14 hours | ~2 days 22 hours |
| **Warehouse Performance** | ~6 days 2 hours | ~4 days 7 hours |
| **Ready-to-Pickup Delay** | ~1 day 13 hours | ~1 day 8 hours |
| **Overall Performance** | ~10 days 20 hours | ~7 days 9 hours |

### 🔍 Key Findings

- **Logistics partner reliability**  
  → Transit times are consistent and meet expectations — a strong point.

- **Pickup delays are acceptable**  
  → Mostly due to truck scheduling; not a major concern.

- **Main bottleneck: Warehouse processing**  
  → This is the **primary area for improvement**. Focus efforts here first.
